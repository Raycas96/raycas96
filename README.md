### Hi Everyone my name is Giuseppe and i'm a software developer!

I started my journey as a developer not so long ago in human years, but if we think about computer science, it's been a long time! I started in 2019, but I've always been a bit of a nerd. I've always liked to take old PCs apart and put them back together, or create game servers before that date!

Other than that, I am a cyber security enthusiast and I have obtained various certifications from the EC-Council. I am currently studying for a degree in SSRI at the Milan Public University.

My main coding language is JavaScript. I use it for pretty much everything (within its limits and capabilities, of course) but i'am open to learn and code in every language.
